**L**iwei's **S**cheme **I**nterpreter — A Scheme interpreter with geometric figure generation.

Watch [demo](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fche4xurlhohbcf/LSI.mp4?dl=0) & [slides(In Chinese)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/84d3bo0gav6qthv/%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E7%AD%94%E8%BE%A9.pptx?dl=0) now!

## Feature

1.  Implemented a closure support interpreter with tail call optimization
2. Enabled user-defined Scheme libraries to draw geometric figure and transform coordinate
3.  Added logger, mock test, unit test, coverage test and CI for different build chain
4. Used GitHub issue tracking system to track progress

## Build from scratch

```
git submodule update --init
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make LSI_CLI
./Interface/CLI/src/LSI_CLI ../Scheme/demo/painter3.scm -p ../Scheme/stdlib
```

(Wait about 20s…)

And find picture in `Scheme/demo`!
